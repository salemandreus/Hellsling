## Platformer Game MVP (7-hour Jam):
#### A personal Challenge
A simple platformer game I put together in C# and Unity at a mini game jam - I was quite proud of it because I managed to put it together from scratch within 7 hours while better familiarising myself with Unity game development at the same time.

#### Note: This Was A *Timeboxed* Challenge
Thus:
* <ins>I purposefully have not improved on it since it was developed</ins>.

* The goal was to push myself and demonstrate my development in a **_new domain_** within a **_7-8 hour game jam deadline_**.
* Thus the main goal was **_not animations or levels_**, but implementing **basic camerawork** and **game mechanics _within the deadline_**.

<ins>Regarding the camerawork</ins>: I concentrated specifically on integrating a certain feel with camera-slide/drag when running or stopping suddenly (which admittedly is more optimal for the feel of a game such as Sonic the Hedgehog with a fair amount of running and less optimal for a precision jump-intensive game like this one, but experimenting outside of the box is fun!)
