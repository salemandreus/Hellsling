## Platformer Game MVP (7-hour Jam):
A simple platformer game I put together in C# and Unity at a mini game jam - I was quite proud of it because I managed to put it together from scratch within 7 hours while better familiarising myself with Unity game development at the same time.

<ins>I purposefully have not added to it since it was developed</ins> - as this repo demonstrates my development within a *timeboxed* game jam. Thus  the main goal was not animations or levels but implementing basic camerawork and game mechanics within a **7-8 hour game jam deadline**.

I concentrated specifically on integrating a certain feel with camera-slide/drag when running or stopping suddenly (which admittedly is more optimal for the feel of a game such as Sonic the Hedgehog with a fair amount of running and less optimal for a precision jump-intensive game like this one, but experimenting outside of the box is fun!)
