# Platformer Game MVP (7-hour Jam):

A simple platformer game MVP I put together in **C#** and **Unity** at a mini game jam within a **7-hour deadline**.

#### This Was A Personal Challenge
 - To <ins>put together a game from scratch within 7 hours</ins> while simultaneously better <ins>familiarising myself with Unity game development</ins>.
<br>

## Important Notes: 

* ### As this was a *Timeboxed* Challenge:
  I purposefully <ins>have not improved on it since it was developed</ins>.

* ### The Challenge:
    * To **_push myself in a new domain_** within a **_7-8 hour game jam deadline_**.
 
Thus:
* ### The Main Goal:
    * was **_not_** any character animations, levels or full-game effects.
      
  but rather:
    * some **_very basic_ placeholder art**.
    * adding **basic platformer game mechanics** - jumping and some solid platforms, relevant physics and transforms.
    * adding **parallax** a.k.a **2.5D**.
    * implementing **basic camerawork** - including camera-slide/drag when running or stopping suddenly.
    * doing this all **_within the deadline_**.

 * ### My Overall Vision:
    * Implementing something with the immersive **feeling** of playing a game like _Jazz Jackrabbit™_. <br> Or, if that's unfamiliar, more like the old _Sonic The Hedgehog™_ platformer game feel, albeit with more precision jumping than speeding required.
